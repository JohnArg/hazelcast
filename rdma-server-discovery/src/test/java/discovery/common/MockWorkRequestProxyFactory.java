     * <p>
     * Provides a Work Request Proxy that can be used for both sending a
     * request and receiving a response. This helps in testing
     * API invocators that call the Discovery API and return a response.
     * Instead of getting different Work Request proxies for a request
     * and a response, as would normally be the case, this factory allows
     * you to reuse the same object for testing.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The {@link CompletableFuture} parameter will be used to complete
     * a Future once the response is sent to the remote side, which happens
     * in another thread. Due to testing,
     * no such sending will actually take place, but a mock representation of
     * an {@link jarg.rdmarpc.networking.communicators.RdmaCommunicator RdmaCommunicator}
     * will simply complete the Future by passing the Work Request proxy's buffer, now
     * containing the response bytes.
     * So, in summary, the {@link CompletableFuture} serves the purpose of waiting until
     * the response is sent by another thread, before being able to test the response's
     * data for correctness.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param responseFuture the future signaling that a response was sent.
     * @return the WorkRequestProxy that can be used in testing.
